## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Ron, a 21-year-old web developer and creator based in Alberta, Canada, and originally from the Philippines. Since middle school, I've been mesmerized by the intersection of art and technology, particularly in the digital realm. This passion led me to explore various creative avenues, including photography and graphic design. However, it was web development that truly ignited my enthusiasm. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and my eye for design, I specialize in crafting visually compelling and dynamic web experiences. Whether it's designing intuitive user interfaces, optimizing for performance, or building responsive websites, I thrive on bringing innovative ideas to fruition through code. My goal is to create immersive online experiences that captivate and leave a lasting impact on users.
